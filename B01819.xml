            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But in any of theſe Caſes before put if a man be hurt or maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, an Action of Treſpaſs lieth againſt him that was the cauſe of the hurt, or maime, though it be done againſt the parties mind and will; becauſe in Civil Treſpaſſes and injuries, that are of an inferior nature, the Law doth rather conſider the damage of the party wronged, then the mind of him, that was the wrong doer.</p>

                        <hi>Vide Hobarts</hi> Reports Weaver againſt Ward f. 134. But to return from whence I have made a digreſſion: It is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether he that commiteth this Homicide by miſadventure in doing a lawful
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180130:21"/>Act, and likewiſe without an evil intent; for if the Act be unlawful, or done with an evil purpoſe, it will prove murther.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Touching an unlawful Act: If a man ſhoot at a Cock or Hen, or any fowl of another man, and the arrow by miſchance kill a man, this is ſaid to be murther, for the Act was unlawful. So if a man doth beat another, and with intent not to kill him, yet if the party be killed by this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, it is felony.</p>
                     <p>So if two are fighting together, and a third cometh to part them, and is killed by one of them two, without any malice fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought,
<note place="margin">11. H. 7.23. a.</note> yet this is murther in him, and not Homicide by Chancemedley, or miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, becauſe that they two that fought together, were in doing of an unlawful Act. And if they were met with prepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed malice, the one intending to kill the other, then it is murther in them both.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Touching an evil Intent: If a man knowing that many people come in the ſtreet from a Sermon, throw a ſtone over a wall, intending only to fear them, or to give them a light hurt, and thereupon one is killed, this is murther, for he had an evil intent, though that intent extended not to death, and though he knew not the party ſlain.</p>
                     <p>Note, though the killing of a man by miſadventure,

                        <p>Touching <hi>Burglary,</hi> there are 3 matters worthy of obſervation: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology or origination of the word. 2. Its Definition: 3. Reſolutions concerning this offence.</p>
                        <p>The word <hi>Burglary,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymology.</note> is derived of two words <hi>Burgh</hi> and <hi>Laron, Burgh</hi> ſignifying an Houſe,
<note place="margin">Co. lib. 4. f. 39. <hi>Brooke</hi>'s Caſe.</note> and <hi>Laron</hi> ſignifying a Thief, as it were a Houſe Thief.</p>
                        <p>This crime, according to the acceptance of our Common Law is thus defined.</p>
                        <p>It is when one breaketh and entereth into the houſe of another in the night, with a felonious intent to rob or kill, or to do ſome other felony; in which caſes, although he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:180130:31"/>carry away nothing, yet it is felony, for which he ſhall ſuffer death.</p>
                        <p>The Reſolutions that are given upon this offence, are theſe following.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Touching fraction and entry:
<note place="margin">4. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions.</note> If the door of a manſion houſe ſtand open, and the Thief enter into the houſe with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſteal, this is a breaking of the houſe in Law, and no Burglary, becauſe there muſt be an actual breaking, for the words of the Indictment are, <hi>Felonice &amp; Burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter fecit, &amp;c.</hi> which are to be underſtood of an actual breaking of the houſe, and not of a breaking in Law.
<note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 64.</note> So it is if the window of the houſe be open, and the Thief with a hook, or other engine draweth out ſome of the goods of the owner: this is no Burglary, becauſe there is no actual breaking of the houſe. But if the Thief breaketh the glaſs of the window, and with a hook or other engine draweth out ſome of the goods of the owner; this is Burglary, for there was an actual breaking of the houſe.</p>
                        <p>If divers come in the night to do a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary, and one of them breaketh and enter, the reſt of them ſtanding neer to the door,
<note place="margin">13. <hi>H.</hi> 4.13.</note> or about other part of the houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to watch that no help ſhall come to defend the owner, this is Burglary in all.</p>
                        <p>But ſometimes Burglary may be committed by entry without any breaking: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; if a ſervant will conſpire with other men to rob his Maſter, and to that intent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:180130:32"/>he openeth his Maſters doors and windows in the night for them, that they come into the houſe by that way, this is Burglary in the ſtrangers, and the ſervant is a thief; but no Burglar.

                        <p>You ſee by what has been ſaid before, that Burglary the Common Law reſtrains to a robbing of a houſe, by night or breaking in, with intent to rob or to do ſome other felony; but the like offence committed by day, we call Houſe-breaking, or Robbing, (and not Burglary) and this kind of felony is provided for by the Stat.

And upon evidence it appeared, that the ſaid <hi>Evans</hi> by a ladder climbed to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per window of the ſaid <hi>Audeley</hi>'s chamber, and took out thereof the ſaid 40. pounds: And that the ſaid <hi>Finch</hi> ſtood upon the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the view of the ſaid <hi>Evans,</hi> and ſaw <hi>Evans</hi> in the chamber, and was aſſiſting to the committing of the ſaid robbery, and took part of the money. And all this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being found, it was adjudged, becauſe the ſaid <hi>Finch</hi> did not enter into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he was not within the Statute of 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which takes away Clergy, where an houſe is broken open, and the robbery is above the value of five ſhillings, no perſon therein, that he ſhould have his Clergy, which was allowed him. And as for <hi>Evans</hi> the ſpecial verdict found, that he was in

And it was reſolved upon this ſpecial verdict (being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by <hi>Certiorari</hi> into the Kings Bench, and the priſoner removed by <hi>Habeas corpus</hi>) that this breaking open the chamber, and taking 40. pounds out thereof, <hi>nulla per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona</hi> being therein (although there were divers perſons in other parts of the houſe) was within the Stat. of 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which takes away Clergy from ſuch offenders: Wherefore Clergy was denyed to the ſaid <hi>Evans,</hi> and Judgment given in the Kings Bench, that he ſhould be hanged.</p>

                        <hi>Burning</hi> is a felony at the Common Law, committed by any that maliciouſly and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily in the night or day,
<note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 66.</note> burneth the houſe of another.</p>
                     <p>Out of which we may obſerve two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:180130:35"/>
                     <p>Firſt; To make it felony, it muſt be done with malice and will; for if it be done by miſchance, or negligence, it is no felony. But whether the Law doth ſometime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that the houſe was burnt maliciouſly, and voluntarily, may be a <hi>Quaere?</hi> It is anſwered, it does: As if one intend to burn the houſe of A. only, and not the houſe of B. and yet in the burning the the houſe of A. the houſe of B. is burnt, in this caſe the burning of the houſe of A, is felony,
<note place="margin">Co 3.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly; to make it felony, it muſt be the houſe of another, and not his own houſe: As for example:</p>
                     <p>One <hi>W. Holmes</hi> was indicted in <hi>London,</hi> for that he being poſſeſſed of an houſe in <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>Throgmorton</hi> ſtreet,

                     <p>By <hi>Richardſon, Jones,</hi> and <hi>Berkcley</hi> it was
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:180130:36"/>held that it was not felony to burn an houſe, whereof he is in poſſeſſion, by vertue of a Leaſe for years: For they ſaid, that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of houſes is not felony, unleſs that they were <hi>aedes alienae:</hi> And therefore <hi>Britton,</hi> and <hi>Bracton</hi> mention that is felony to burn the houſe of another: and the Year-Books and <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Powlters</hi> Caſe, which ſay, that burning of houſes generally are to be intended <hi>de aedibus alienis, &amp; de non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priis:</hi> And although the Indictment be <hi>ea intentione ad comburendum felonice, &amp;c.</hi> yet intent only without fact, is not felony: Alſo <hi>Barkeley</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> held, that it cannot be ſaid <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> when it is in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and therefore it was reſolved that it was not felony, wherefore he was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereof: But becauſe it was an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant offence, and found, they ordered that he ſhould be fined 500. pounds to the King, and impriſoned during the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſhould ſtand upon the Pillory, with a paper upon his head, ſignifying the offence at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and at <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> upon the Market day, and where he committed the offence, and ſhould be bound with good ſureties to his good behaviour during life.</p>

                  <p>To depoſe the King, or to take the King by force and ſtrong hand, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon him untill he hath yeilded to certain demands; this is a ſufficient overt Act, to prove the compaſſing and imagination of the death of the King: for this is upon the matter to make the King ſubject, and to deſpoil him of his Kingly Office of Royal Government. And ſo it was reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England Hill.</hi> 1. <hi>Jac. Regis,</hi> in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:180130:37"/>the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray, Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clarke</hi> Seminary Prieſts.</p>

                  <p>If any man ſhall attempt to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo ſtrong, that the King ſhall not be able to reſiſt him, he is guilty of Rebellion. In the like manner, the Law interpreteth that in every Rebellion there is a machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the life of the King and his depoſing: For a Rebel will not ſuffer that King to live or reign, which may afterwards puniſh or revenge ſuch the treaſon or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.

                  <p n="1">1. by the <hi>Imperial</hi> or Civil Law,

                  <p>So one <hi>Crobagan,</hi> an Iriſh man was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned of Treaſon; for that he being the Kings Subject at <hi>Lisbone</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:180130:38"/>and was tryed by a Jury of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and it was directly proved by two Merchants, that he ſpake theſe words at <hi>Lisbone</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in great heat of ſpeech, with Captain <hi>Baske,</hi> and added theſe words, Becauſe he is an Heretick; and for that his traiterous intent and the imagination of his heart, is declared by theſe words, it was held High treaſon by the courſe of the Common Law, and within the expreſs words of the Statute of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. And he coming into <hi>England,</hi> and being arrreſted by Warrant for this cauſe, moſt inſolently put his finger into his mouth, and ſcornfully pulling it out, ſaid, I care not this for your King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which ſpeeches and actions, though he now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, the Jury found him guilty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he had Judgment accordingly.

                  <p>So one <hi>Henry Challercomb</hi> was indicted of Treaſon for words, and was found guilty, and executed.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>John Williams</hi> was alſo indicted, found guilty, and executed, for writing a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Book, called <hi>Balaam Caſe.</hi> Theſe two laſt Preſidents you may ſee cited in <hi>Pyne</hi>'s Caſe, in <hi>Crokes</hi> third part of his <hi>Reports.</hi>

                  <p>It is commonly ſaid, That bare words may make an Heretick, but not a Traitor, without an overt Act: And therefore to make compaſſing by bare words or ſayings, High treaſon, it muſt be by ſome particular Statute, ſuch were the Statutes of 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 13.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Phil. and Mar. c.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. <hi>Eliz: c.</hi> 1. but all theſe are either repealed or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired:

                  <p>Touching Miſpriſion, 4 things are to be principally obſerved; The Etymology of the word, its Deſcription, its Diviſion, and the Puniſhment therefore.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Etymology or Origination of the word:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Miſpriſion,</hi> cometh of the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Meſpris,</hi> which properly ſignifieth neglect or contempt; for <hi>(mes)</hi> in Compoſition in the <hi>French</hi> ſignifieth <hi>mal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 36.</note> as <hi>mis</hi> doth in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Tongue: as miſchance, for an ill chance, and ſo <hi>Miſpriſe</hi> is ill apprehended or known.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its Deſcription:</p>
                  <p>In legal underſtanding Miſpriſion of treaſon, is either when one knoweth, that another hath committed treaſon, and will not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him to the King or to the Councel, or to any Magiſtrate, but doth conceal the ſame; it is when one hath committed ſome hainous offence under the degree of treaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its Diviſion:</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:180130:45"/>
                  <p>Miſpriſion of treaſon is twofold: 1. Paſſive, called <hi>Crimen omiſſionis,</hi> as in concealment, or not diſcovery of treaſon: And therefore by the Statute of 5. &amp; <hi>E.</hi> 6. concealment or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecret of any High treaſon, is declared only Miſpriſion of Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>As for example:
<note place="margin">13. <hi>El. c.</hi> 2.</note> It is Miſpriſion of High treaſon in concealing of a Bull from the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the receiving of one that hath counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the Kings Coyn,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dyer f.</hi> 296 <hi>Coyners</hi> Caſe.</note> and comforting of him, knowing him to have counterfeited the King Coyn, is but a Miſpriſion.</p>
                  <p>But by the Common Law, concealment of High treaſon, was Treaſon, as appeareth in the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Scrope</hi> anno 3. <hi>H.</hi> 5, and by <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 118. <hi>b,</hi> &amp; 119. <hi>a.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And with our Common Law, the words of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> to <hi>Nicooles</hi> are agreable; <hi>viz. Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem poena digni ſunt ſupprimentes hujusmodi facinus, qua facinoroſi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Active, called <hi>Crimen commiſſionis,</hi> as in committing ſome heinous offence, under the degree of Treaſon;
<note place="margin">37. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br.</hi> Tit. Treaſon.</note> as when one fixes an old Seale of a Patent to a new Patent of Non-Reſidence, this is holden to be a Miſpriſion of Treaſon only, for it is an abuſe of the great Seale, and not counterfeiting of it.</p>
                  <p>So if a man know Money to be counterfeit, and bring the ſame out of <hi>Ireland</hi> hither into <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 140.</note> and utter it in payment, this is but a Miſpriſion, and no Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>So the compaſſings or imaginations againſt the King by word, without an overt Act, is a High Miſpriſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:180130:45"/>4. The puniſhment of this offence.</p>
                  <p>In all Caſes of Miſpriſion of Treaſon, the party offendour ſhall forfeit his Goods and Dutie for ever, and the profits of his Lands for terme of his life, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned during life.</p>
                  <p>From which puniſhment if any will ſave himſelf, that knoweth of any High treaſon, he ought with as much ſpeed as conveniently he may, to reveal the ſame to the King, or ſome of his Privy Councel, or any other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirate.</p>
                  <p>Note, that in every Treaſon or felony, is included Miſpriſion, and where any hath committed Treaſon or felony, the King may cauſe the ſame to be indicted, and arraigned, but of Miſpriſion only, if he will,</p>

                  <p>Extortion is a Miſpriſion by wreſting, or unlawfully taking by any Officer by Colour of his Office, any money or valuable thing of or from any Man, either that is not due, or more then is, or before it be due, <hi>Quod non eſt debitum,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of this crime it is ſaid, that in no other

<note place="margin">Co. Lit. 368. <hi>b.</hi>
                     </note> for Robbery is apparent, and hath a face of a crime, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion puts on the vizor of vertue, for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtice and the like, and it is ever accompany'd with that grevious ſin of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; we call it in Latin <hi>Crimen expilationis, ſeu concuſſionis.</hi>

                  <p>But the <hi>Quaere</hi> may be whether Extortion and Exaction are all one? It is anſwered, They are not, for there is this difference taken between Exaction and Extortion: Extortion is where an Officer demandeth and wreſteth a greater ſumme or reward, than his juſt Fee: And Exaction is where an Officer or other Man demandeth and wreſteth a Fee or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where no Fee or reward is due at all.</p>

                  <p>This Accuſation is often done before the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180130:61"/>Coroner, who either is aſſigned to the felon by the Court to take and record that which he ſaith, or is called by the felon himſelf, and required for the good of the Prince and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to record that which he ſhall ſay.</p>
                  <p>If upon his appeal all thoſe Partners be convicted, the King <hi>ex merito Juſtitioe</hi> is to pardon him. But it is in the diſcretion of the Court either to ſuffer him to be an Approver,

                  <p>Note; If a Man that is of good fame be appealed by an approver, by which he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and kept in priſon, yet het may have a writ, to be directed to the Sheriff, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to ſuffer the Party appealed to be Bayled by good ſureties.

                     <p>Acceſſory by the Common Law is alſo of two ſorts §.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Acceſſory before the offence or fact; and it is he that commandeth or procureth an other to commit felony, and is not there preſent himſelf, when the other doth it, but if he be preſent, then he is alſo a principal: As where I. S. doth hold I. X. and commands I. D. to kill him, whereupon I.

                     </p>
                     <p>So a Woman ſervant conſpired to rob her Miſtreſs, and brought a Stranger to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,

<note place="margin">2 &amp; 3 <hi>Eliz. Dyer f.</hi> 128.</note> but holding the candle, the two Chief Juſtices and Hare, thought the Servant a Traitreſs and a principal.</p>
                     <p>If a Man counſelleth a Woman to murther the Child being in her Body,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dyer f.</hi> 186.</note> and after the Child is born, and then is mudered by the Woman in the abſence of him that ſo gave the Counſel; yet he is acceſſary before the fact, by his counſelling, before the birth of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and not countermanding it.</p>

                        </note> that in Man-ſlaughter a Man cannot be acceſſary before the fact, for Man-ſlaughter enſueth upon a ſudden debate or Affray, for if it be premeditated, it is murder.</p>

                     <p>The Duty of the Kings Councel learned in the Laws is to manage the Evidence againſt the priſoner at his Tryal, and the Function of the Clerk of the Crown is to frame, read, and record all Indictments againſt Traytors, Felons, and other Offenders Arraigned in the Kings Bench upon any publique Crime.</p>

<note place="margin">Co. 2. Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 22.</note> but they are not ſo called, as ſome have ſaid, becauſe the King <hi>Jure Coronae,</hi> ſhall have the Suite and Common Pleas, becauſe they be held by

                  <p>But now, how theſe criminal matters are brought to a judicial hearing, is the queſtion; It is anſwered, that they are brought by way of Accuſation, and Exception.</p>
                  <p>Accuſation doth proceed either by way of Appeal,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations.</hi>
                     </note> or by way of Indictment; and firſt of Appeals.
<note place="margin">Appeal.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Appeal, <hi>Appellum,</hi> cometh of the French word <hi>Appeller</hi> that ſignifieth to accuſe,
<note place="margin">Co. Litt. 123. <hi>b.</hi> 126. <hi>b.</hi>
                     </note> or to appeal, or appeach. An Appeal is therefore an Accuſation of one upon another, with a purpoſe to attaint him of Felony, by words ordained for it.</p>
                  <p>Now Appeals are of three ſorts:
<note place="margin">Co. Litt. 287. <hi>b.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of wrong to his Succeſſor, whoſe heir he is, and that is only of Death, which is of two ſorts, of Murder, &amp; of Manſlaughter; but of Chancemedley, no Appeal doth lye.</p>
                  <p>As touching Appeal of Murder this Quaere is put.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Whether Tryal of Murder by Appeal ought to be brought in the County, where the fact was committed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is adjudged, that in an Appeal of Murder, the writ ſhall abate if it be not brought in the County, where the fact was committed; for it is againſt a fundamental Rule of Law, that a Tryal of murder by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:180130:68"/>Appeal, or otherwiſe,
<note place="margin">Cro. 3. part. <hi>Sont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, v. Price</hi> 247.</note> ſhall be out of the County where it is perpetrated: And for this cauſe, it was doubted at the Common Law, where a ſtroak were given in one County, and death enſued in another, how it ſhould be tryed? And to avoid this doubt the Stat. of 2. <hi>E.</hi> 6. was made.</p>
                  <p>But it alwaies was clear, that a fact in one County ought not to be tryed in another.</p>
                  <p>Note, the Stat. of 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 6. allows that Indictments may be in County's next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning; but there is not any mention of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals; and for this reaſon Certioraries have been granted, to remove Indictments out of the Grand Seſſions in Wales.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>Qu. 1. <hi>Whether all Appeals ought to be ſued in proper Perſon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is anſwered, that all Appeals are to be ſued in proper Perſon, and not by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,
<note place="margin">21. <hi>E.</hi> 4.72, &amp; 73.</note> as Appeal of Maihem muſt be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſon. A Woman, which was <hi>Groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment euſeint,</hi>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:180130:70"/>did ride to <hi>Iſlington</hi> to her, to ſee if ſhe were alive, and deſired Execution, which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the Defendant had Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Qu. 2. <hi>Whether an Appeal may be commenced more then one way?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is anſwered, that Appeals are commenced two wayes, either by Writ, or by Bill.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Writ, when a Writ is purchaſed out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> by one Man, againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, commanding him that he ſhall appeal a third Man of ſome felony, or other offence by him committed, and to find Pledges, that he ſhall do this with effect, and this Writ is to be delivered to the Sheriff to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Bill, when a Man of himſelf giveth his Accuſation of another Man in Writing to the Sheriff, or Coroner, and taketh upon himſelf the burthen of appealing him that is named in the ſaid Writing.</p>
                  <p>And note, that there is a diverſity worthy of obſervation, betwixt an Appeal by Bill, and by Writ: for in the Appeal by Original Writ both principals and acceſſories,
<note place="margin">Co. 2. Inſt. <hi>f.</hi> 183.</note> are generally charged alike, without any diſtinction, who be principals, and who be acceſſories: but otherwiſe in the Appeal by Bill.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Accuſation by way of Appeal. I proceed now to ſpeak of the other kind of Accuſation; <hi>viz.</hi> by Indictment.</p>
                  <p>Indictment cometh of the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Enditer,</hi>

                  <p>For the clearer underſtanding of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, take theſe following Rules.</p>
                  <p>That there be words ſo appropriated to offences criminal,
<note place="margin">Reg. 1.</note> that they cannot be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally by any other words, or Periphraſis.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Rapuit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rape.</note> in an Indictment of Rape, muſt be uſed, for <hi>carnaliter cognovit eam,</hi> or the like will not ſerve.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> There is a great difference between an Attainder of treaſon or felony, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into Religion; for he that is attainted of treaſon or felony,

                  <p>Qu. 2. <hi>When a felony is perpetrated, whether there be a Diſcrimination in Law betwixt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of Lands before, and after Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi>

                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> If a Man commit felony, and after purchaſe Land, and then is attainted, he has capacity to purchaſe, but not to hold it, for in that caſe the Lord of the fee ſhall have the Eſcheat:

<note place="margin">Co. 3. Inſt. 215.</note> or maimed, or a Woman attainted, be raviſhed, after Pardon, they ſhall have an Action of Battery, Appeal of Maime, or Rape.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:180130:76"/>
                  <p>It is to be known,
<note place="margin">Co. Litt. 390. <hi>b.

                  <p>Now, as upon conviction a Delinquent forfeiteth his good and Chattels; ſo upon At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, that is by Judgment given, his Lands and Tenements are forfeited: But touching the forfeiture of Lands, there is a diverſity betwixt an Attainder of felony, by outlawry upon an Appeal, and upon an Indictment; for in the caſe of an Appeal of death or other felony,
